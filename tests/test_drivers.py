"""
Golden tests for the driver generator (scripts/drivers.py).

DriverEmitter is a whitespace-exact partial evaluator whose output feeds
every render in the build; a regression there silently changes all 200
outputs. These tests pin its behavior on the test song
(src/test/demo.ly.tera) against a checked-in expected driver, and check
the derived-metadata contract the templates rely on.

Regenerate the fixture deliberately after an intended weave/emitter
change:

    python -m scripts.drivers songs out/derived/test/demo.ly.toml \\
        tests/expected_demo_driver.ly.tera
